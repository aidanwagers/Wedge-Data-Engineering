# Overview
The Wedge is a Minneapolis Co-op that provided data to our professor for use in this excercise. The data was provided in the form of over 50 CSV files zipped in different formats. This presented a challenge in taking the data from its raw form, to a cleaned and usable Pandas dataframe, to Google Big Query for analysis, and finally a local SQL database. The project was split into three tasks, I will provide more detail on each individual task below.
